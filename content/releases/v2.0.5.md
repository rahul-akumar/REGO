# Release Notes v2.0.5

This release focuses on theming stability and polish, correct deployment assets (favicon) for GitHub Pages, and improved page title handling across the site. It is a focused, non-breaking patch that improves the visual consistency and deploy-time correctness of the documentation site.

## Theming & Design Tokens

- Consolidated theme tokens and added stable theme classes
  - Theme variables are centralized in [`app/assets/css/themes.css`](app/assets/css/themes.css:1) to make adding and maintaining color themes straightforward.
  - Several named themes (sapphire, emerald, topaz, ruby, amethyst, teal, scaled, mono, etc.) were formalized with both light and dark variants, exposing consistent CSS custom properties for components and layout.
  - Chart color variables and sidebar tokens were standardized (e.g., `--chart-1…--chart-5`, `--sidebar-primary`, `--sidebar-ring`) so visual components can consume the same palette across the site.

- Improved theme scale & responsiveness
  - The scaled theme provides responsive typography and spacing tokens under a media query to ensure better layout proportions on wide viewports.
  - Theme-specific responsive overrides reduce layout regressions across breakpoints.

- Reduced visual flash / FOUC and stabilized dark-mode behavior
  - Theme application is handled via the [`useTheme` composable](app/composables/use-theme.ts:1), which now:
    - Reads and persists `color-theme` and `is-dark` to localStorage.
    - Applies / removes `theme-<name>` classes on the root element and toggles `.dark` consistently.
    - Provides utilities to cycle themes and toggle mode for runtime control.
  - Default behavior leans toward a stable dark mode (initial default) while honoring stored user preferences.

- CSS variables exposed to components
  - `app/assets/css/global.css` now maps a wide set of semantic variables (color-background, color-foreground, color-primary, color-sidebar, color-chart-\*) to the theme CSS properties so UI components and docs pages consume semantic tokens rather than hard-coded colors.

## Favicon & Deployment Asset Fixes

- Corrected favicon path for GitHub Pages deployment
  - The app head configuration in [`nuxt.config.ts`](nuxt.config.ts:1) includes a link to the favicon that is aware of the site's baseURL (`/REGO/`), ensuring the favicon loads correctly when served from GitHub Pages.
  - This change prevents 404s for the favicon on the deployed site and ensures consistent branding across pages.

- Asset path hygiene
  - All site-level asset references (icons and favicons) were audited to respect `baseURL` so static assets resolve correctly when the site is hosted under a sub-path.

## Page Titles & SEO

- Improved title template and per-page titles
  - The global title template in [`nuxt.config.ts`](nuxt.config.ts:1) was clarified to use `"%s REGO"` so pages render consistent, readable titles (e.g., "Components · REGO").
  - Per-page titles in the docs now map properly into the template for better discoverability and consistency.

- Better prerender metadata
  - The prerendering behavior and head metadata were validated to ensure static generation includes the updated title template and favicon links for each static page.

## Minor UX & Implementation Notes

- Theme picker & initialization
  - The theme initialization runs on mounted in the default layout (`app/layouts/default.vue`), ensuring the chosen theme is applied early in the client lifecycle to minimize layout shifts.
  - The `useTheme` composable exposes a small API (initTheme, setColorTheme, toggleMode, cycleTheme) to let UI controls (theme pickers) operate predictably.

- No API-breaking changes
  - This patch does not introduce breaking changes to component APIs. Changes are limited to site configuration, CSS, and the theme composable behavior.

## Migration Notes

- Upgrade guidance
  - No code changes required for component usage.
  - If you previously referenced the favicon at an absolute path, confirm it uses the configured `baseURL` (or a relative/reference under `/REGO/` when deploying to GitHub Pages).
  - If you implement custom theme switching, prefer the `useTheme` composable / semantic CSS variables to keep behavior consistent with the site.
