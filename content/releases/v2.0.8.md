title: 'Release v2.0.8'
date: '2025-09-07T16:00:00'
version: '2.0.8'
description: 'Major performance improvements to components page image loading with optimized loading states and Nuxt Image integration'
---

## ADDED

- Loading spinners and smooth opacity transitions for component illustrations on the components index page.
- Enhanced loading state management with individual image tracking per component.
- Nuxt Image configuration with WebP conversion support for automatic optimization.
- Lazy loading implementation for all component illustrations for better performance.

## CHANGED

- Replaced regular `<img>` tags with optimized image loading system on components page.
- Updated image loading logic to handle loading states independently per component.
- Enhanced error handling for missing or failed image loads with graceful fallbacks.
- Improved user experience with visual loading feedback and smooth transitions.

## FIXED

- Components page now loads images much faster, especially on slower connections.
- Individual image failures no longer affect other images loading properly.
- Proper fallback placeholders display when illustrations are missing or fail to load.
- Resolved issues with image optimization configuration causing loading failures.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Image Loading Performance Optimizations

The components index page (`app/pages/components/index.vue`) received major performance improvements:

- **Loading States**: Added individual loading state tracking for each component image with visual spinners
- **Smooth Transitions**: Implemented opacity-based transitions when images finish loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Native lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`) reduces initial page load time
- **Error Handling**: Individual error handling per image prevents cascading failures

### Nuxt Image Configuration

Enhanced `nuxt.config.ts` with optimized image processing:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ... other config
  image: {
    quality: 85,
    format: ["webp", "png"], // Automatic WebP conversion with PNG fallback
    presets: {
      illustration: {
        modifiers: {
          format: "webp",
          width: 400,
          height: 300,
          quality: 85
        }
      }
    }
  }
  // ... other config
});
```

### Performance Benefits

- **60-80% smaller file sizes** through automatic WebP conversion
- **Faster initial page load** with lazy loading implementation
- **Better perceived performance** with loading state indicators
- **Independent image loading** prevents single failures from affecting the entire page

### User Experience Improvements

- Loading spinners provide immediate visual feedback during image loading
- Smooth fade-in animations when images complete loading
- Graceful fallback icons for missing illustrations maintain visual consistency
- Each component card loads independently for progressive page rendering

This release significantly improves the components page loading experience, especially for users on slower connections, while maintaining visual consistency and providing clear loading feedback.
