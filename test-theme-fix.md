# Theme Persistence Fix - Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed
- **Problem**: Theme settings were not consistent across different pages/layouts
- **Root Cause**: Theme initialization only happened in the default layout, not globally
- **Solution**: Created a global Nuxt plugin to initialize themes consistently

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`

2. **Test Theme Persistence**:
   - Go to `/themes` page
   - Change the theme from "Default" to any other theme (e.g., "Sapphire")
   - Refresh the browser (F5)
   - ✅ **Expected**: Theme should remain "Sapphire", not revert to default
   - Navigate to `/components` 
   - ✅ **Expected**: Theme should still be "Sapphire"
   - Navigate to any other page
   - ✅ **Expected**: Theme should remain consistent

3. **Test Dark/Light Mode**:
   - Toggle dark/light mode on any page
   - Refresh the browser
   - ✅ **Expected**: Dark/light mode preference should be preserved
   - Navigate between pages
   - ✅ **Expected**: Dark/light mode should remain consistent

4. **Test Different Layouts**:
   - Test theme consistency on:
     - Main page (likely uses default layout)
     - `/themes` page (uses full-width layout)
     - `/components` page (uses default layout)
   - All should show the same theme after changes and refreshes

## Files Changed
- ✅ **Created**: `app/plugins/theme.client.ts` - Global theme initialization
- ✅ **Modified**: `app/layouts/default.vue` - Removed redundant theme init

## Before vs After
- **Before**: Inconsistent theme loading between layouts
- **After**: Consistent theme loading across all pages and layouts
